              competition and immediately received this award. Experts noted the
              amazing aroma and luxurious taste of our wine. This award has

              In 1992, in conditions of very tough competition from winemakers
              in our state, our wine managed to take first place. It was
              preferred by most critics of Orange Wine Fund. They noted the
              bright and rich taste of our Pinot Noir, its ruby color, and
              intense aroma.
