          <p class="timeline__description">
            Our family has been engaged in winemaking since the 18th century
            when the first grape bushes were planted in the Napa Valley by our
            ancestors.

          <p class="timeline__description">
            Our home-based winery in California became a small, family-owned
            business, that supplied wine for connoisseurs of this amazing drink.

          <p class="timeline__description">
            After the Second World War, we adopted the experience of European
            winemakers and began to use new technologies in our wine-making
            processes.

          <p class="timeline__description">
            We used to sell our wines only wine only in California. But since
            2010, we have been shipping our bottles to other American states and
            even other countries.
