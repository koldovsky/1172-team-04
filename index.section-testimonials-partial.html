            "I really like to please myself with good wine with a rich taste.
            Therefore, from time to time, I order wine directly from the
            CaliWines winery. I also buy Chardonnay and Cabernet for family
            holidays. We are completely delighted with the amazing taste of
            these wines, which we want to enjoy endlessly."

            "We were to hold a responsible event with a buffet table and wanted
            to surprise our guests with some local products. I recalled that we
            have the CaliWines winery in California and ordered 10 bottles of
            Chardonnay. Our guests were delighted and asked for the name of the
            producer!"

            years. We order the whole range of wines from them. We are
            completely satisfied with the quality of the wine supplied to us.
            And our guests often choose CaliWines from our wine menu."
